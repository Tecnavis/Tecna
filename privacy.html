Update or correct the information. If our data is incorrect or outdated, you may request a correction.
Ask us to delete your data. You may request deletion of your personal information if there is no legitimate need for us to retain it. You can also request the deletion when you exercise your right to object to processing.
Object to processing. This term refers to a situation where your personal circumstances make you unwilling or unable to agree to the retention and transmission of your personal information, even when we have a legitimate interest in keeping it. You may also use this right to limit the extent of our transmission and sharing of your personal data. For instance, you may object to our sharing of your personal data with specific corporate or government entities.
Object to automated decision-making. We use personal data to conduct automatic decision-making based on the personal profiles of our visitors. You may object to this use of your data. You may also ask us to delete your personal profile.

Our protocols ensure differing levels of security measures that depend on the sensitivity of this data. We will only keep your data in storage and process it for as long as necessary to meet our business and other obligations.
                             We may keep personal data when we are required to do so by legal and regulatory obligations. In the case of a legal or civil claim, we will use your personal data as needed to meet our legal and contractual obligations. Your data may help us process responses to charges and complaints. When we have met these legal and contractual obligations, we will destroy your data in a secure manner.
                            We will retain your personal records when we are required to do so by law or regulatory requirements.
